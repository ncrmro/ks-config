# Job Management

This folder and its subfolders are managed using `deepwork_jobs` workflows.

## Recommended Workflows

- `deepwork_jobs/new_job` - Full lifecycle: define → implement → test → iterate
- `deepwork_jobs/learn` - Improve instructions based on execution learnings
- `deepwork_jobs/repair` - Clean up and migrate from prior DeepWork versions

## Directory Structure

```
.
├── .deepreview        # Review rules for the job itself using Deepwork Reviews
├── AGENTS.md          # This file - project context and guidance
├── job.yml            # Job definition (step instructions are inlined here)
├── hooks/             # Custom validation scripts and prompts
│   └── *.md|*.sh      # Hook files referenced in job.yml
├── scripts/           # Reusable scripts and utilities created during job execution
│   └── *.sh|*.py      # Helper scripts referenced in step instructions
└── templates/         # Example file formats and templates
    └── *.md|*.yml     # Templates referenced in step instructions
```

## Editing Guidelines

1. **Use workflows** for structural changes (adding steps, modifying job.yml)
2. **Direct edits** are fine for minor instruction tweaks
