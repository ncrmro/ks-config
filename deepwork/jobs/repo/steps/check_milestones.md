# Check Milestones

## Objective

Verify milestone-issue consistency: each milestone's issues are properly labeled, states are correct, and milestone metadata is complete.

## Task

### Process

1. **Read milestones** from `platform_context.md`

2. **For each open milestone, verify:**

   a. **Issues exist** — milestone has at least one issue
   - GitHub: `gh issue list --repo {owner}/{repo} --milestone "{title}" --state all --json number,title,state,labels`
   - Forgejo: `tea issue list --login forgejo --repo {owner}/{repo} --milestone "{title}"`

   b. **Consolidated issue exists** — look for an issue whose title matches the milestone title
   (this is the "tracking issue" pattern where a parent issue tracks the milestone's work)
   - Flag if missing, but do not create it (just report)

   c. **Labels are correct** — each issue should have at least one of the required labels
   (`product`, `engineering`, or `plan`)
   - Flag issues missing all three labels

   d. **State consistency** — if all issues are closed, the milestone should be closeable
   - Flag milestones where all issues are closed but milestone is still open

3. **Compile findings per milestone**

# Milestones Report

## Summary

- **Total Open Milestones**: [count]
- **Milestones with Issues**: [count]
- **Empty Milestones**: [count]
- **Issues Missing Labels**: [count]

## Milestones

### [Milestone Title] (#[number])

- **Open Issues**: [count]
- **Closed Issues**: [count]
- **Consolidated Issue**: [found (#N) | missing]
- **Unlabeled Issues**: [count]
  - #[N] — [title]
- **State Issues**: [none | "all issues closed but milestone open"]
```

## Quality Criteria

- Each milestone's issues are listed with state and label correctness
- Missing consolidated issues are flagged
- Unlabeled issues are identified
