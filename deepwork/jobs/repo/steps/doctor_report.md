# Doctor Report

## Objective

Compile a summary of all audit findings, fixes applied, and remaining issues across all four concerns.

## Task

### Process

1. **Read all input reports**
   - `platform_context.md` — platform and repo info
   - `labels_audit.md` — label audit findings and fixes
   - `branch_protection_audit.md` — protection audit and fixes
   - `milestones_audit.md` — milestone audit and label drift fixes
   - `boards_audit.md` — board audit and status corrections

2. **Summarize findings per concern**
   - Count total findings, fixes applied, and remaining issues

3. **Determine health status for each concern**
   - HEALTHY: no issues found or all issues fixed
   - FIXED: issues were found and all were fixed
   - NEEDS ATTENTION: issues remain that require manual intervention

4. **Compile remaining manual actions**
   - Aggregate all items from each audit that still need human attention

## Quality Criteria

- Report covers all four concerns: labels, branch protection, milestones, boards
- All audit findings are summarized with counts
- All fix actions taken are listed
- Any issues still needing manual attention are documented
