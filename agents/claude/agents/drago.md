---

## Version Control

## Pre-Commit Hygiene

Before committing, ensure the working tree is clean and matches the intended state. For strategic guidance on searching project history and discovering requirements using git tools, see `process.project-navigation`.

1. Before committing, the working tree MUST be checked for files that should be gitignored (e.g., `.env`, `node_modules/`, build artifacts).
2. `git status` MUST be reviewed before every commit to verify only intended files are staged.
3. Files matching `.gitignore` patterns MUST NOT be committed — if they appear in status, the `.gitignore` MUST be fixed first.

## Conventional Commits

4. Commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): subject`.
5. Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`.
6. The scope SHOULD identify the affected area (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`, `nix`, `ci`).
7. PR titles MUST also follow the `type(scope): subject` format.
8. The subject SHOULD match an existing spec, milestone, or issue name — avoid introducing new subjects when an existing one fits.

## Commit Discipline

9. Commits MUST be early and often — each commit SHOULD represent one logical change.
10. Dependency additions or updates MUST be in their own dedicated commit (e.g., `chore(deps): add serde`).
11. When doing TDD, the failing test MUST be committed separately from the implementation that makes it pass.
12. Commits MUST NOT bundle unrelated changes — split them into separate commits.

## Cloning Repositories

15. Repos MUST be cloned to `.repos/{owner}/{repo}` relative to the agent-space root — never to the home directory or agent-space root.
16. Internal Forgejo repos MUST use SSH URLs: `git clone ssh://forgejo@git.ncrmro.com:2222/{owner}/{repo}.git .repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
17. GitHub repos MUST use `gh repo clone {owner}/{repo} .repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
18. Full clones MUST be used — do NOT use `--depth 1` unless explicitly requested.
19. The `.repos/` directory MUST be gitignored.

## Rebasing & Lock Files

For rebase conflict resolution, lockfile handling, and advanced git operations, see `process.version-control-advanced`.

# Convention: Enable by Default (process.enable-by-default)

Keystone treats the entire fleet as a single system. Features are enabled by
default, configuration auto-derives from shared registries (`keystone.hosts`,
`keystone.services`, `keystone.domain`), and every host or agent receives the
full capability set unless explicitly opted out. This minimizes the total lines
of config across both keystone and nixos-config, preventing a sprawl of
per-host `enable = true` flags that must be maintained in lockstep.

## Default-On Principle

1. New keystone module options MUST default to `true` (enabled) unless there is
   a concrete reason to require opt-in (e.g., the feature needs external
   credentials, has a cost, or conflicts with other modules).
2. Options that only make sense when another option is set (e.g., `tasks.enable`
   when `mail` is configured) SHOULD auto-enable via `mkDefault true` when
   their prerequisite is met, rather than requiring a separate `enable = true`
   in nixos-config.
3. When a feature requires per-host credentials (e.g., mail password, API token),
   the feature MAY default to `false` but MUST document in its description what
   prerequisite enables it.
4. Developers MUST NOT add `enable = true` flags in nixos-config for features
   that are already default-on in keystone — redundant flags obscure which
   settings are actual overrides vs boilerplate.

## Fleet as a Single System

5. Module configuration MUST auto-derive from shared registries
   (`keystone.hosts`, `keystone.services`, `keystone.domain`) rather than
   requiring per-host declarations in nixos-config.
6. When a host registry field (e.g., `journalRemote = true`) determines
   behavior for the entire fleet, the module MUST consume that field directly
   — not require each host to also set `keystone.os.journalRemote.upload.enable`.
7. Cross-host concerns (e.g., journal forwarding, binary cache, DNS) SHOULD
   require exactly one declaration in the host registry; all other hosts
   MUST auto-configure from that single source of truth.
8. New modules MUST NOT require mirrored config in both keystone and
   nixos-config — the keystone module should derive everything it can from
   options already available in the evaluation context.

## Agent Environment Parity

9. Agents MUST receive the same terminal environment as human users — no
   cherry-picking individual tools or features. See `os.requirements` rules
   12-15 for the systemd-level enforcement of this principle.
10. When a terminal submodule is enabled for any user on a host, it SHOULD
    be enabled for all agents on that host unless the agent definition
    explicitly opts out.
11. Agent-specific overrides (e.g., different mail credentials) MUST use the
    agent submodule options, not separate module-level flags.

See `process.keystone-principal-parity` for the implementation discipline
(shared provisioning scripts, option symmetry, divergence documentation)
that enforces this parity at the code level.

## Config Reduction Reviews

12. During the `ks-develop` workflow review step, reviewers SHOULD check
    whether the change introduces new per-host config that could instead be
    auto-derived from existing registries.
13. When reviewing PRs, reviewers SHOULD flag `enable = true` lines in
    nixos-config that duplicate a keystone default — these SHOULD be removed.
14. Periodic config audits SHOULD scan nixos-config for options that merely
    restate keystone defaults and remove them.

## Exceptions

15. Features with external costs (e.g., cloud API calls, paid services) MAY
    default to `false`.
16. Features that conflict with each other (e.g., two mutually exclusive
    desktop compositors) MUST default to `false` with a clear selection
    mechanism.
17. Experimental or unstable features MAY default to `false` until they are
    considered production-ready.

## Golden Example

Before this convention — adding cfait (CalDAV tasks) to the fleet required
three separate changes:

```nix
# nixos-config/home-manager/ncrmro/base.nix (consumer config)
keystone.terminal.tasks.enable = true;    # manual opt-in

# nixos-config/hosts/ocean/default.nix (server config)
# nothing needed here, but the pattern invites it

# keystone/modules/terminal/tasks.nix (module definition)
enable = mkOption { default = false; ... };
```

After this convention — cfait auto-enables when its prerequisite (mail) is
configured:

```nix
# keystone/modules/terminal/tasks.nix
enable = mkOption {
  type = types.bool;
  default = mailCfg.enable;  # auto-on when mail is configured
  description = "Enable CalDAV task management TUI (cfait)";
};

# nixos-config — no change needed. The feature activates because
# mail is already configured. Zero config maintenance.
```

Similarly, journal-remote and ZFS backup auto-derive from `keystone.hosts`
(see also `os.zfs-backup` for the ZFS application of this pattern):

```nix
# nixos-config/hosts.nix — single declaration
ocean = { journalRemote = true; ... };

# Every other host auto-forwards. No per-host upload config needed.
# The module reads keystone.hosts and configures itself.
```

---

# Convention: Writing and Prose (process.prose)

Standards for writing clear, concise, and professional prose across all project
communications, including issues, notes, and general documentation.

## Clarity and Conciseness

1. Prose MUST be succinct, delivering maximum information with minimum words.
2. Prose MUST prioritize clarity and ease of understanding.
3. Sentences SHOULD be short and direct. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
4. Passive voice SHOULD NOT be used when the subject of the action is known.
   Bad: "The report was finished by the team."
   Good: "The team finished the report."
5. Filler words and phrases (e.g., "basically", "actually", "at this point in time", "in order to") SHOULD NOT be used.

## Grammar and Punctuation

6. The Oxford comma (serial comma) MUST be used for all lists of three or more items to ensure unambiguous separation.
7. American English spelling MUST be used (e.g., "organization" not "organisation").
8. Punctuation MUST be placed inside quotation marks in narrative text.

## Formatting and Structure

9. All narrative text MUST be formatted using Markdown.
10. Titles and headings MUST use sentence case (e.g., "Weekly status update" not "Weekly Status Update").
11. Dates MUST follow the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) or use full month names (e.g., "March 23, 2026") to avoid regional ambiguity.
12. Large blocks of text SHOULD be broken up with lists or sub-headings to improve readability.

## Tone and Accessibility

13. The tone MUST be professional, objective, and helpful.
14. Gender-neutral language MUST be used (e.g., "they/them" instead of "he/she").
15. Narrative SHOULD avoid unnecessary jargon or obscure metaphors.

## Golden Example

### Topic: System Migration Schedule

The migration to the new storage backend will occur over three days to minimize
service interruptions.

#### Schedule

1. Infrastructure preparation MUST be completed by 2026-04-01.
2. Data synchronization SHOULD begin immediately following the preparation.
3. The final cutover MUST NOT occur until all synchronization tasks are verified.

#### Communication

We will notify all stakeholders via email, the project board, and the internal
chat system once the migration is complete.

# Convention: Standard Utilities (tool.standard-utilities)

Standards for using common Unix and development utilities (`jq`, `yq`, `rg`, `sed`, `awk`) within the keystone environment. These tools are pre-installed on all keystone hosts. For strategic guidance on using these tools for project navigation and discovery, see `process.project-navigation`.

## JSON Processing (jq)

1. `jq` MUST be used for parsing and filtering JSON output from APIs and CLI tools. See `tool.process-compose-agent` Rule 5 for its application in service orchestration.
2. Complex `jq` filters SHOULD be broken into multiple pipes for readability.
3. For scripts, use the `-r` (raw-output) flag when extracting string values to avoid unwanted quotes.
4. `jq` filters MUST handle missing keys gracefully using the `?` operator or `//` default values.

## YAML Processing (yq)

5. `yq` (mikefarah/yq) MUST be used for YAML manipulation in scripts and CI/CD pipelines.
6. When converting YAML to JSON for further processing with `jq`, use `yq -o=json eval '.'`.
7. In-place edits with `yq -i` MUST be backed up or performed within a git-tracked directory to allow for reversal.

## Searching (rg/ripgrep)

8. `rg` (ripgrep) MUST be the primary tool for searching text within files. For requirement discovery using Requirement Prefixes, see `process.project-navigation`.
9. For searching code, use the `--type` flag (e.g., `rg --type nix`) to narrow results and improve performance.
10. `rg` SHOULD be used with `--hidden` to include hidden files (e.g., `.env`, `.github/`) and `--no-ignore` if searching ignored files is necessary.
11. Large search results SHOULD be piped to `head` or `less` to avoid overwhelming the terminal or agent context.

## Text Processing (sed/awk)

12. `sed` and `awk` SHOULD only be used for simple stream edits where `jq` or `yq` are not applicable.
13. For complex text transformations, prefer specialized tools or small script fragments (Bash/Python) over intricate `sed`/`awk` one-liners.
14. `sed` commands MUST use a delimiter other than `/` if the pattern contains slashes (e.g., `sed 's|/old/path|/new/path|'`).

## Performance and Safety

15. Tools MUST NOT be used on binary files unless specifically designed for them.
16. For large-scale find-and-replace, use `git grep` or `rg` with `xargs` to ensure safety and speed. For using `git grep` in project navigation and requirement discovery, see `process.project-navigation`.
17. Avoid piping secrets or sensitive data into these utilities unless the output is immediately redirected to a secure location.

## Environment and Tool Availability

18. Projects SHOULD utilize Nix devshells (`nix develop`) to provide required tools when possible. In repositories where introducing Nix configuration is undesirable, tools MUST be provided by the pre-installed host environment or a local untracked shell. See `tool.nix-devshell` for standards on project-specific environments.

# Convention: VCS Context Continuity (process.vcs-context-continuity)

Standards for maintaining real-time visibility and state tracking on issues and
pull requests to ensure that any agent or human can seamlessly resume
in-flight work.

## Real-Time Progress Tracking

1. The `# Tasks` checklist in the PR body (or Issue body) MUST be updated
   immediately as each sub-task is completed.
2. If the implementation plan changes or a sub-task is found to be
   unnecessary, the checklist MUST be updated to reflect the new path.
3. If a task is skipped or pivoted, a brief comment MUST explain why the
   change was made.

## Environmental and Technical Blockers

4. Any difficulties encountered with the development environment (e.g.,
   missing dependencies, flakey tests, Nix evaluation errors) MUST be
   documented as a comment on the tracking Issue or PR. See `process.blocker`
   for the authoritative standard on escalating blockers.
5. If a "workaround" or temporary hack is required to proceed, it MUST be
   explicitly noted so the next agent understands the non-standard setup.
6. System-level issues that affect the developer experience (DX) SHOULD be
   reported as separate infrastructure issues while referencing the current
   task.

## Observable Evidence

7. Every PR MUST provide observable evidence of progress (screenshots for
   UI, terminal output code blocks for CLI, or video for complex interactions).
   See `tool.terminal-screenshots` for specific PNG rendering standards.
8. Evidence MUST be updated if subsequent changes significantly alter the
   observable behavior of the feature.
9. For backend or library changes, the demo MUST include logs or test output
   demonstrating the code working in a realistic scenario. See `process.pull-request`
   for structural PR requirements.

## Resumability and State

10. The PR/Issue history MUST provide enough context for another agent to
    understand the current delta between the stated Goal and the current
    branch state. See `process.task-tracking` for internal state standards.
11. Before pausing work, the agent MUST ensure all local changes are pushed
    to the remote branch and the platform (Issue/PR) accurately reflects
    the current progress.

## Golden Example

An agent is implementing a new UI component but hits a build issue:

### PR Body Update:

    # Tasks
    - [x] Create component scaffold
    - [x] Implement theme support
    - [ ] Add interaction tests
    - [ ] Update documentation

### Comment on PR:

    ## Technical Note: Build Environment

    The local `node_modules` required a manual `pnpm install --force` due to
    a version conflict in the shared archetype. I have noted this in the
    `# Tasks` for anyone picking up the next sub-task.

    ## Progress Demo
    ![Screenshot of the component in light and dark mode](https://example.com/demo.png)

    The interaction tests are currently failing because the test-runner cannot
    find the new fonts; I have pushed my WIP fixes to the branch.

---

# Convention: Project Navigation (process.project-navigation)

Standards for how agents effectively navigate, discover requirements, and inspect
information within a project to minimize context usage and time-to-discovery.

## Requirement Discovery

1. The project-level agent configuration file (e.g., `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`) MUST declare the **Requirement Prefix** (e.g., `SPEC-`, `REQ-`, `TODO-`) used throughout the codebase.
2. Agents MUST use `rg` (ripgrep) with the declared Requirement Prefix to identify relevant files and sections when investigating a task or bug.
3. When searching for requirements in git history, agents MUST use `git grep` or `git log -G` with the Requirement Prefix.

## Structured Data Inspection

4. Agents MUST use `jq` or `yq` to inspect JSON and YAML files respectively, rather than reading the entire file content.
5. Before reading an unknown structured file, agents MUST inspect its top-level keys using `yq 'keys' <file>` or `jq 'keys' <file>` to understand the schema.
6. For large structured files, agents MUST use filtered queries to extract only the necessary nodes (e.g., `yq '.services.web' docker-compose.yml`) to keep the context window lean.

## Efficient Filesystem Exploration

7. Agents SHOULD check the size of a file using `ls -lh <file>` before attempting to read it in full.
8. If a file exceeds 50KB, agents MUST NOT read it in its entirety; they MUST use `read_file` with `start_line` and `end_line` or `grep` to extract relevant sections.
9. Agents SHOULD use `glob` or `list_directory` to map the directory structure before exploring file contents to avoid "blind" reads.

## LSP and Documentation

10. Source code MUST be documented using language-standard conventions (e.g., Python Docstrings, JSDoc, Rustdoc) to enable LSP-based discovery.
11. Agents SHOULD utilize available Language Servers (e.g., `nil` for Nix, `rust-analyzer` for Rust) via provided tools to perform cross-reference lookups and symbol searches.
12. When investigating unfamiliar symbols, agents SHOULD use LSP features like "Go to Definition" or "Find References" before resorting to manual `rg` searches.

## Golden Example

### Finding Requirements for a Feature

The agent needs to find the spec for "TPM Unlock". `AGENT.md` says the prefix is `SPEC-`.

```bash
# Fast discovery of relevant files
rg "SPEC-.*TPM Unlock"
```

### Inspecting a Large Configuration File

The agent needs to know the memory limit for the `db` service in a 2000-line `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
# 1. Check file size (it's large)
ls -lh docker-compose.yml

# 2. Inspect keys to confirm structure
yq 'keys' docker-compose.yml

# 3. Extract exactly what is needed
yq '.services.db.deploy.resources.limits.memory' docker-compose.yml
```

### Navigating Code with LSP

Instead of `rg "my_function"`, use LSP to find where it's defined and used.

```bash
# (Conceptual) Use LSP tool to find definition
lsp_definition path/to/file.py --line 42 --char 10
```

# Convention: Process Compose Agent Interaction (tool.process-compose-agent)

## Overview

Standards for AI agents interacting with a running `process-compose` server.
`process-compose` is an agent-friendly orchestrator, but improper interaction
can lead to hung execution, context window exhaustion, or brittle health checks.

## Headless Interface

1. Agents MUST NOT trigger the TUI (Terminal User Interface).
2. Running `process-compose` or `process-compose attach` without a subcommand MUST be avoided as it expects an interactive TTY and will hang the agent.
3. Agents SHOULD use the MCP Server (`process-compose-mcp`) if available for strictly typed tool access. See `tool.cli-coding-agents` for tool configuration paths.
4. Agents MAY use the REST API (default `http://localhost:8080`) by consuming the OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.yaml`.
5. When using the CLI, agents MUST request JSON output using `-o json` for reliable parsing. See `tool.standard-utilities` Rule 1 for `jq` parsing standards.

## Log Reading

6. Agents MUST NOT use the `-f` (follow) flag or attempt to stream logs continuously.
7. Log retrieval MUST be bounded using `--tail` (e.g., `process-compose process logs <name> --tail 100`).
8. Agents MUST strip ANSI color codes to preserve context window space and avoid breaking parsers.
9. The `--log-no-color` flag or `PC_LOG_NO_COLOR=1` environment variable MUST be used for all log commands.
10. Agents MUST NOT grep logs for readiness or health checks.
11. Readiness MUST be determined by polling the API or CLI for the `is_ready` status flag of the managed application service.

## Service Management

12. Agents MUST NOT use OS-level `kill` commands to restart services.
13. Native commands (e.g., `process-compose process restart <name>`) MUST be used to ensure graceful shutdown and respect configured backoffs.
14. After issuing a restart, agents SHOULD wait for the configured backoff period before verifying status.
15. Agents MUST respect the dependency graph; before restarting a foundational service, they SHOULD identify and monitor dependent services.

## Advanced Tactics

16. If connection is refused or unauthorized, agents MUST check for API tokens (`PC_API_TOKEN`) or Unix Domain Sockets (`PC_SOCKET_PATH`). See `process.sandbox-agent` for environment availability.
17. Agents SHOULD use `process-compose project update` to apply configuration changes (YAML or `.env`) without restarting the entire stack. See `process.keystone-development` Rule 11 for platform dev standards.
18. For complex boot failures, agents SHOULD inspect the dependency graph via the `/graph` API or `process-compose graph --format json`.
19. Agents MAY dynamically scale services using `process-compose process scale <name> <count>` if the application supports the `${PC_REPLICA_NUM}` environment variable. See `tool.standard-utilities` Rule 1 for parsing scaled output.

## Golden Example

An agent diagnosing a failing service and applying a fix:

    # 1. Check status (JSON)
    process-compose process list -o json

    # 2. Fetch last 50 lines of logs without colors
    process-compose process logs backend --tail 50 --log-no-color

    # 3. Apply a fix to the .env file
    echo \"DB_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/db\" >> .env

    # 4. Update the project configuration dynamically
    process-compose project update

    # 5. Verify readiness
    process-compose process list -o json | jq '.[] | select(.name==\"backend\") | .is_ready'
